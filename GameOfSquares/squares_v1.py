"""Solution to the Square Game puzzle.

Usage: update the ITERATION and run `python squares_v1.py`,
the INIT_SHADE can be modified to have a different start point as well.

Note: This implementation is slow as the iteration goes bigger 
because it calculates the lateral for the grid for each iteration.
